# swCAM(debCAM2.0)：Sample-specific Deconvolution
We have developed a deconvolution tool (debCAM, https://github.com/Lululuella/debCAM) that can dissect mixed signals of multiple samples into the ‘averaged’ expression profiles of subtypes. Many subsequent molecular analyses of complex tissues require sample-specific signal deconvolution where each sample is a mixture of ‘individualized’ subtype- specific expression profiles. Here we developed a new algorithm called swCAM (debCAM2.0) as an extension of debCAM to solve sample-specific Blind Source Separation (sBSS) problem.
